# Loan Default Prediction

Many people struggle to get loans due to insufficient or non-existent credit histories. And, unfortunately, this population is often taken advantage of by untrustworthy lenders.

This study aims to explore the possibility of building a model that predicts the probability on whether a given customer profile will default on a loan or not based on their transaction history.
